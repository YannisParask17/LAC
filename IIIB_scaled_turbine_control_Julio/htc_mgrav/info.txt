Here I run a HAWC2 round without wind and a rigid st.
We get the gravitational moments in the tower base to plot the theoretical
tawer base moment.

    We didn't get to discuss this in class, so I'll recommend you a way to do it.

    Although it would be exciting to calculate by hand, it usually ends up being
    a little cumbersome. So I would recommend just doing a short simulation with
    NO wind or turbulence (you could use one of the steady htc files as a template)
    and then just extracting the tower-base moment at the end of the simulation.

    To be totally pedantic, you should run this simulation with a rigid tower (and
    blades), but to be honest I don't mind if your gravity moment is not super
    accurate. It changes anyway with flexible blades/towers at different wind speeds.

    Please comment here if you have questions!
